# Tableau Dashboard Portfolio Showcase
Welcome to my Tableau Dashboard Portfolio Showcase repository! Here, I'm excited to present a collection of my past data visualization projects, crafted using Tableau. Within this repository, you'll find two key dashboards that offer insights into diverse datasets.

Customer Overview Dashboard: Explore a comprehensive snapshot of customer demographics, including age distribution, geographical locations, educational background, portfolio sizes, and more. This dashboard provides a holistic view of customer data, enabling insightful analysis and strategic decision-making for businesses.

HR Analytics Dashboard: Delve into the dynamics of workforce management with this HR analytics dashboard. Gain valuable insights into employee demographics, tenure at the company, departmental distribution, gender representation, and trends related to employee retention and attrition. This dashboard equips organizations with crucial information to optimize HR strategies and enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

I invite you to explore these dashboards and witness the power of data visualization in unraveling meaningful insights. Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback. Enjoy your exploration!
