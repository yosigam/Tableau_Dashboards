# Tableau Dashboard Portfolio Showcase
Welcome to my Tableau Dashboard Portfolio Showcase repository! Here, I'm excited to present a collection of my past data visualization projects, crafted using Tableau. Within this repository, you'll find two key dashboards that offer insights into diverse datasets.

Customer Overview Dashboard: Explore a comprehensive snapshot of customer demographics, including age distribution, geographical locations, educational background, portfolio sizes, and more. This dashboard provides a holistic view of customer data, enabling insightful analysis and strategic decision-making for businesses.

Please note that these are projects I created some time ago. While they may not reflect my current skill level, they demonstrate my proficiency in Tableau and data visualization techniques at that time.

I invite you to explore these dashboards and witness the power of data visualization in unraveling meaningful insights. Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback. Enjoy your exploration!
